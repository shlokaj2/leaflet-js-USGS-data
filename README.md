# leaflet-js-USGS-data


I have created and added all the necessary files and folders for the leaflet challenge. I had also created the Leaflet-Part1 and Leaflet-Part2 folders, but for some reason they are not showing up when I push to the repository in GitHub.It is currently incomplete though because I am having some trouble with the assignment. 
Any code I put in to create the graphs on the dataset doesn't work. I will continue to work on it and resubmit it at a later time.
