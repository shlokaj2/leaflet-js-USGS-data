# leaflet-js-USGS-data


I have created and added all the necessary files and folders for the leaflet challenge. I had also created the Leaflet-Part1 and Leaflet-Part2 folders, but for some reason they are not showing up when I push to the repository in GitHub. It is all completed except for the legend. The legend is not there on the map because the code for that part is not 
working for some reason.
